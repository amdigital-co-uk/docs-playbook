And if it is worth saying once, it is worth saying again and again. Just because you have told someone something, it doesn't mean they have remembered it or understood it. Over-communicating isn't oversharing though; succinctness is kindness, critical detail should follow.</li> <li>Ask stupid questions - There are no stupid questions - if someone is explaining something and you're unsure about it, ask them to explain it again. If they are not explaining in a way that resonates with you, ask if they can explain it in a way that does. If someone has told you something and you don't remember what they said, be comfortable asking them again - we are all growing and you won't be able to remember everything you are told.</li> <li>Be transparent &amp; informative - Making information available to others is transparency.

It was created by Facebook and has gained a lot of popularity among developers for its declarative and efficient approach to building web applications. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. By using TypeScript with React, developers can write more reliable, maintainable, and scalable code with fewer errors. In this context, it's important to follow best practices and guidelines to ensure that your code is of the highest quality. In this post, we've provided some guidelines and best practices for writing React code in TypeScript that can help you write better code and improve the overall quality of your application.</p>"},{"location":"Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Quality-Standards/React-Best-Practises/#guidelines-for-writing-react-code-in-typescript","title":"Guidelines for Writing React Code in TypeScript","text":""},{"location":"Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Quality-Standards/React-Best-Practises/#writing-in-react","title":"Writing in React","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Read and understand the official React documentation: The React documentation at https://react.dev/ is a valuable resource for learning about React and its ecosystem. Take the time to read and understand the documentation, and follow the best practices and recommendations provided by the React team. This will help you write better code and avoid common pitfalls in your React applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use semantic HTML: React will still output HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; with that in mind, it's important we use semantic HTML tags that describe the content of the page rather than just the appearance. This will help with accessibility and search engine optimization, and make your code easier to read and maintain. For further reading, MDN has a good article on semantic HTML.</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow useState best practices: Removing redundant and duplicate data from the state helps ensure that all its pieces stay in sync, similar to how a database engineer normalizes the database structure to minimize bugs. See choosing the state structure for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow useEffect best practices</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't use unnecessary useEffect: Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone. See you may not always need an effect for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't use objects in your useEffect: Don't include objects in the dependency array, which can lead to unintended consequences. This is because objects are compared by reference, not by value. If the object reference changes, even if the object properties are the same, the effect will be triggered again. See some reactive value change unintentionally for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep your components small and focused: Break your UI into smaller, reusable components that are focused on a single responsibility. This will make your code easier to test, maintain, and understand. As a rule of thumb, aim to keep each component under 100 lines of code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add global files: Enhance the structure by introducing additional folders such as \"constants\" for storing application-wide constants, \"colors\" for maintaining a color palette, and \"styles\" for global CSS styling.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be careful of excessive prop drilling: Avoid excessive prop drilling by using React Query or React Context. These provide a centralized store for managing the state of your application and can help you avoid passing props down through multiple levels of components. Alternatively lifting the state up can help reduce prop drilling see Kent C Dodds article on application state management with react. React.dev also has a great tutorial on managing state. Note we haven't yet needed a global state but lightweight libraries like zustand or jotai could fit that need depending on the use case.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reuse logic with custom hooks: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks to avoid code duplication and improve the reusability of your components. Custom hooks can be used to encapsulate logic related to data fetching, state management, and other common patterns. By using custom hooks, you can make your code more modular and easier to test and maintain. See reusing logic with custom-hooks for more details.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use strict mode: Use the React strict mode to enable additional checks and warnings for potential problems in your code. This can help you catch potential issues early and improve the overall quality of your code.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Quality-Standards/React-Best-Practises/#structuring-your-code","title":"Structuring your code","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Use the Atomic Design Methodology: The Atomic Design Methodology is a system for designing and building UI components in a structured and scalable way.

Consistent code style improves readability and maintainability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Code quality and readability: Evaluate the code for clarity, readability, and maintainability. Look for concise and descriptive variable and function names, proper indentation, and comments where necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular and reusable components: Encourage the use of modular components that have a single responsibility and can be easily reused throughout the application. Avoid large, monolithic components that are difficult to understand and maintain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Handling state and props: Check if the state and props are used appropriately. Avoid unnecessary state management and prefer lifting the state up when needed. Ensure that props are properly validated using PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conditional rendering: Review the usage of conditional rendering. Make sure it is clear, concise, and avoids unnecessary complexity. Consider alternatives like using the logical AND operator (&amp;&amp;) instead of ternary operators for conditional rendering when applicable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoiding Unnecessary Closing Tags: Make sure that closing tags are used only when necessary. In React, self-closing tags are preferred for elements that don't have any children. For example, instead of '</p>', you can use '' to indicate a self-closing tag.<p></p> </li> <li> <p>Eliminate empty tags: Check for instances where tags are rendered without any content or purpose. If a tag doesn't contain any meaningful content or attributes, it may be unnecessary and can be safely removed. Empty tags can clutter the code and make it harder to understand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Effective use of hooks: Verify that React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext are used correctly. Ensure that hooks are placed in the correct order and follow the rules of hooks (e.g., not using hooks inside loops or conditionals).</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance considerations: Assess the code for any potential performance bottlenecks. Look for inefficient rendering, excessive re-renders, or unnecessary computations. Suggest optimizations if applicable, such as memoization or using useMemo and useCallback hooks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Error handling: Check if error handling is implemented appropriately. Look for proper error boundaries, handling of asynchronous errors, and displaying helpful error messages to users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test coverage: Evaluate if the code changes are adequately covered by unit tests or integration tests. Encourage adding or updating tests to maintain good test coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistency with existing codebase: Ensure that the code aligns with the existing architecture, patterns, and practices followed in the project.

In the instance of a failing test with a known fix in the works, we should use <code>test.fixme</code> instead, explained above.</p> <p>We can merge tests with <code>test.skip</code> annotations into the main branch, but it is important that we review these tests frequently to ensure they are not forgotten.</p> <p>Use of <code>test.fail</code> or <code>@fail</code></p> <p>We do NOT support the use of <code>test.fail</code> or <code>@fail</code> to mark a test that is known to be failing.

A common approach is to name them based on the feature or page they are associated with, followed by the word \"Definitions\" (e.g., DocumentsListDefinitions.ts, ListPageDefinitions.ts).</p> </li> <li> <p>Folder structure: Store step definition files in a dedicated folder, typically named step-definitions.

This approach simplifies the process of locating the code related to specific scenarios. (Example: If you have a loginPage.ts create a LoginPageDefinitions.ts step-definition file).</p> </li> <li> <p>Modularity: Write modular step definitions by breaking down complex actions into smaller, reusable functions. This practice promotes maintainability and enables you to reuse code across multiple steps and scenarios.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameterization: Use parameters in your step definitions to make them more flexible and reusable.

Smoke testing notes are often written or at least started in this phase, and later revised in the Smoke Test Implementation state. </p>"},{"location":"Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Test-Engineering/Testing-workflow/#what-is-the-difference-between-manual-and-exploratory-testing","title":"What is the difference between Manual and exploratory testing?","text":"<p>In a nutshell, manual testing is generally very structured and rigid, it involves writing out test steps and then executing them. What it lacks is the ability for a tester to think outside the box and have the freedom to use their skills, experience and knowledge. Although manual testing can have its place and benefits, so can exploratory testing and it is a combination of these test types (including automation), which contribute to test coverage and overall quality and confidence in testing. </p> <p>For more information on Exploratory testing, please see: Exploratory Testing </p> <p>For more information on the differences between Manual and Exploratory testing, please see: Exploratory Testing Vs Scripted Testing </p>"},{"location":"Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Test-Engineering/Testing-workflow/#qa-test-execution","title":"QA Test execution","text":"<p>This should involve: - Running playwright tests on ALL browsers (where applicable) </p> <p>The above should be run against the relevant repo, in GitHub actions:</p> <p>EDEN - DAM E2E Tests</p> <p>Qts-clients - Clients manager E2E Tests</p> <p>qtui front end - Front End / CMS E2E Tests</p> <p>qtui front end - Front End / CMS Regression Tests</p> <p>qtms-oai - OAI Open Archives Initiative (API) E2E Tests</p> <p>For more information, please also see the following document: Process to follow when running E2E tests after releases</p>"},{"location":"Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Test-Engineering/Testing-workflow/#what-is-the-triage-loop","title":"What is the triage Loop?","text":"<p>As a result of QA Test Execution, defects may be discovered which need to be fixed, deployed and re-tested.

However, the reason Smoke test Implementation is added after QA execution is a result of the possible Triage loop (explained above). If a defect is found which requires a change to development implementation, then a corresponding test will need to be updated or written (if no existing coverage). Ideally, we would be covering this with automation. However, it's also not a bad idea to have a smoke test note to manually verify it upon release. This is a 'sanity' test and gives further confidence in the quality. </p>"},{"location":"Ways-of-Working/Toolkit/Test-Engineering/Testing-workflow/#live-test-execution","title":"Live Test execution","text":"<p>This should involve:</p> <ul> <li>Running ALL E2E tests, on all repos, (where applicable)</li> <li>Running E2E tests on ALL browsers (where applicable)</li> <li>Executing Smoke tests (usually on Chrome)</li> </ul> <p>If any Bugs are found on Live environments then (depending on the Risk/Result of that bug) we either roll back to a previous deployment version or create a new Backlog Item to fix the Bug. </p>"}]}
