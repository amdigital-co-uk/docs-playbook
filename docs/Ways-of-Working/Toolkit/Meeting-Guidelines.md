# Meeting Guidelines

### What is a Meeting?

A scheduled calendar event where people come together to figure something out, make decisions, or align on stuff.

### What Isn‚Äôt a Meeting?

- Hopping on a quick call to collaborate or brainstorm.
- Pair programming or working through code together. That‚Äôs just teamwork.

## Guidelines for Meetings

### General Rules

- **Use the 25/50 Rule**: Schedule meetings to last no longer than 25 or 50 minutes to ensure focus and to provide breaks between meetings.
- **Breaks for Long Meetings**: If you have to go over an hour, include a 5-10 minute break every 45-60 minutes. Stretch, grab a hot drink, get away from the computer for a few minutes. 


### Before the Meeting

#### Involve the right people

- Make it clear if attendance is required or optional.
- Establish roles where needed, if a facilitator or minute-taker is needed, ask someone to take on the role beforehand and outline it in the invite.

#### Set an Agenda (and share it early):

- All meetings should have an agenda. Put it in the invite or share it ideally at least 24 hours in advance.
- Ensure the agenda specifies the meeting's **purpose** and desired **outcomes**. Why are we meeting? What‚Äôs the goal?
- If the meeting doesn‚Äôt have a clear purpose or outcome, consider whether it‚Äôs necessary. No agenda? No meeting. Simple.

#### Pre-Meeting Materials:

- Share any documents, slides, data or context that participants need to prepare in advance. People should not be caught off guard.

#### Inclusive Scheduling:

- Be mindful of time zones and individual preferences when scheduling, this can be particularly appropriate when working with our contractors.
- Consider whether this meeting is necessary. Could it be an email, or Teams thread? 


### During the Meeting

#### Start with a Recap:

- Open with a quick review of the agenda so everyone's on the same page.

#### Facilitate Effectively:

- Have a facilitator to guide the discussion, keep time, and ensure everyone has a chance to contribute.
- If it's a regular meeting, think about rotating facilitation duties among team members to distribute ownership. No-one wants to be "the meeting person".

#### Foster Inclusivity:

- Allow space for all voices. Use structured turns or techniques like hand-raising in virtual calls to include quieter participants.
- Encourage colleagues to contribute in ways that work for them. Sometimes typing something in the chat is easier, allow people to contribute in the way that works for them.
- Record a meeting if there are interested attendees who are unable to attend.

#### Stick to the Agenda:

- Respect the outlined topics. If new ideas arise, park them for future discussion.

#### Finish on time

- Make sure the meeting finishes when it says it will.
- Schedule a follow-up meeting if it looks like it will overrun.


### After the Meeting

#### Action Items:

- Summarise **clear, actionable takeaways** during the meeting.
- Assign responsibilities and set deadlines for follow-ups. Who‚Äôs doing what? By when?

#### Document and Share:

- Write up meeting notes, including actions and decisions made, and share them with participants promptly. Post it in Teams, tag people in Loop, use whatever works best for the participants.

#### Feedback:

- Is this a regular meeting? Don't be afraid to ask for feedback on the meeting to improve future sessions. Keep it simple. Ask the team: "What worked? What didn‚Äôt?"

## Tips for Effective Meetings in a Remote-First Environment
- **Use Video Selectively**: Allow participants to turn their cameras off if it helps them focus or feel comfortable.
- **Leverage Tools**: Use the right tools for the job
    - **Miro** for collaboration and brainstorming
    - **Azure DevOps** or Microsoft To Do for tracking tasks and actions.
    - **MS Teams** for a little ‚úã or üëç energy.
- **Reduce Overlap**: If something can be resolved asynchronously, consider whether a meeting is the best format.
