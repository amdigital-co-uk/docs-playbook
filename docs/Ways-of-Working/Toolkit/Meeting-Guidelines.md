## Meetings & Types

### What is a meeting?

A meeting is a scheduled calendar event where people come together to figure something out, make decisions, or align on important matters.

### What *is not* a Meeting?

- Hopping on a quick call to collaborate or brainstorm.
- Pair programming or working through code together. That’s just teamwork.

### Meeting Types

There are many different types of meeting, which influence their nature. They can broadly be grouped into the following categories:

1. **Decision Making**
      - Where a specific decision needs to be made as the primary outcome.
2. **Design & Problem Solving**
      - Where the outcome is to identify possible solutions to problems 
3. **Communication, Learning & Alignment**
      - Where information is shared to and the outcome is to create alignment or improve group knowledge
4. **Connection**
      - Where the outcome is to strengthen relationship and build culture
   
Meetings that attempt to combine multiple categories may suffer from lack of clarity or struggle to reach a meaningful outcome.

In addition, meetings have other common qualities, such as:

- Strategic or tactical
- Recurring or one-off
- Facilitated, chaired, or collaborative
- Pre-read required
- Synchronous or asynchronous

## Guidelines for Meetings

### General Guidance

- **Objective oriented**: Meetings should always state their objective(s), so that everyone is clear what the group aims to achieve.
- **End 5 minutes early**: Meetings longer than 30 minutes should end 5 minutes early by default.
- **Breaks for long meetings**: If your meeting goes beyond an hour, include a 5-10 minute break every 45-60 minutes.
- **Accept/decline meetings**: Respond to invites promptly ("Accept and send response"). If you can't make it, decline so people aren't left guessing.

### Before the Meeting

#### Objective & Format

1. An objective should be shared when the meeting is initially booked.

      - A clear **meeting objective** is more important than an agenda.
      - A good meeting objective should describe both the purpose (why you're meeting) and the outcome (what success looks like).
      - **If the objective isn’t clear, the meeting probably isn’t necessary.**

      Examples: 

      - "To align on product priorities for the next sprint, so that we can create a plan."
      - "To discuss and create a better understanding of problem X, and identify next steps."

1. Determine and communicate an appropriate format:

      - Short meetings are not better than long ones, it is more important to make the meeting effective rather than quick.
      - In person meetings are better for longer meetings or complicated and complex issues.
      - "Async" meetings often work well for simple decisions and communications, and can remove scheduling issues. 

#### Attendees

 - Make it clear if attendance is required or optional.
 - Make it clear if attendees can be added by others (forwarding) or requested.
 - Establish roles where needed, if a facilitator or minute-taker is needed, ask someone to take on the role beforehand and outline it in the invite.


#### Agenda & Flexibility

- Agendas are useful for many meeting types, especially tactical ones.
- Where possible, allow agendas to be flexible to enable real-time adjustments.
- Sharing agendas in advance can help everyone prepare effectively.

#### Pre-Meeting Materials

- Share relevant documents, data, or context well in advance if possible.
- For meetings with deep context (strategy, planning), consider a short read-ahead memo.
- Alternatively, adopt the "Amazon style" – spend the first 5-10 minutes reading together in silence before discussion.
- Be considerate of the time and context switching burden, your priorities aren't the same as others.


### During the Meeting

#### Start Strong

- Restate the meeting objective.
- Summarise the purpose and any key background points.

#### Chairs, Facilitators and Note Takers

- Assign a chair or facilitator to:
    - keep the meeting focused and on track.
    - capture and share outcomes, decisions, and actions
    - Tips:
      - Use time-boxing to ensure each topic gets appropriate attention.
      - If decisions are needed, allocate time for debate and resolution.
      - Record the meeting if appropriate.
  - Assign a note taker if required to:
    - Keep a record of the conversation, to provide context for actions and decisions
  - Consider using transcriptions instead of a note taker, as it is hard to participate in fluid conversations while capturing notes. 

#### Encourage Healthy Conflict and Foster Inclusion

- Actively seek out diverse perspectives and healthy ideological conflict by mining for conflict.
    - For example, ask: "What’s the counterpoint to this idea?" or "Is there a risk we’re overlooking?"
- Allow space for all voices. 
    - Use workshopping techniques such as structured turns, hand-raising in virtual calls, or break-out groups 
    - Practice active listening, repeat back what you have understood to produce clarity.
- Psychological safety leads to better outcomes. Debate ideas, not people.
- Encourage colleagues to contribute in ways that work for them. Sometimes typing something in the chat is easier.

#### Minimise Slides

- Use PowerPoint or slides sparingly. Prioritise discussion over presentation.
- Slides often shift attention away from discussion. Use them to support, not lead, the conversation.
- If slides are needed, keep them short and sharp. Don't read from them.

#### Action-Oriented Mindset

  - Apply a bias towards action. Keep discussions time bound and move to decisions and determining actions:
      - Identify clear decisions.
      - Assign actions and owners.
      - Clarify targets and deadlines.

#### Stay Focused

- Stick to the objective. If tangents arise, note them and return to them later.
- Park non-urgent or off-topic discussions for follow-up.

#### Finish on Time

- Respect people's calendars and energy.
- If needed, schedule a follow-up rather than overrunning.

### After the Meeting

#### Record Outcomes, Decisions & Actions

- Summarise and share with attendees promptly after the meeting:
  - the outcome and key takeaways
  - actions including owners and timelines.
  - meeting notes (if taken)
- Capture important decisions in the Decision Log

#### Feedback and Improvement

- Gather feedback to help improve future meetings of this nature
- Regularly evaluate if recurring meetings are:
    - Still required
    - Still effective

## Tips for Effective Meetings in a Remote-First Environment

### Use Video Thoughtfully
    
      Cameras are encouraged to help foster better collaboration, but not always required. Certain types of meetings and conversations benefit from visual cues more than others.
        - Attendees should be considerate of their colleagues ability to engage.  
        - Meeting organisers should be considerate of camera fatigue. 
        - Where appropriate, it is great to let individuals choose. Where cameras are essential, it is best to make this clear in advance.
  
### Use collaboration tools
    - **Whiteboards (e.g. MS Whiteboard or Miro)** for collaboration
    - **Notes & Lists** (e.g. Loop, Azure DevOps, MS To Do, or MS Planner) for tracking tasks and actions.
    - **MS Teams reactions and hand raises** for participation and energy
