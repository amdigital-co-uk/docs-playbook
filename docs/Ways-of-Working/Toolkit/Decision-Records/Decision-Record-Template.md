This template is the default structure to be used for decision records.

In addition to this, the record must clearly show the current state, problem owner, and decision owner properties.

## Title

A short description of the decision to be made.

## Context

What situation or need triggered the decision?

Keep this to a brief paragraph that can be used as a summary in the decision log. Describe:

- The business or technical problem
- Relevant constraints, projects, objectives, outcomes 
- Any urgency or timing considerations

## Proposal

This is the outcome of the research process. The decision being made is whether to accept this proposal.

- State the proposed decision concisely.
- Ensure you clearly explain why this proposal has been made (over alternatives)
- Ensure it is clear and actionable.
- Use declarative language "We will do x" rather than "we could do x"

!!! note "Request for Comments"
    When submitting RFCs, you may propose multiple options in order to gain feedback, and ideally clarify your preference (and why).

### Considerations

What is the impact of this proposal?

- Describe the benefits and drawbacks / pros and cons

## Alternatives

List the main options considered and why they werenâ€™t chosen. For each alternative, include:

- Each alternative's pros/cons
- Why it was rejected

## Decision conclusion

[Once a decision has been made, briefly summarise the decision and any deciding factors. Ensure that the Resolved Date and status are updated.]
