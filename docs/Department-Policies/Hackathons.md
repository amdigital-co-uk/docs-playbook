## Hackathons

Hackathons are a way to experiment, learn, and solve problems creatively and collaboratively.  

Hackathons should aim to develop our understanding **and** create business value. 

While some hackathons may seek only to perform experiments, for the most part they should aim to produce meaningful enhancements to our platforms, services, and capabilities as a team.

This guide outlines how hackathons work in our department, from proposal through to sharing outcomes.

!!! Success "Anyone, anytime"
     Hackathons can be run at any time! Not just once a year.

## Types of hackathon

We support two formats:

### Minihacks
- Duration: **1 day only**
- Low-cost, lightweight, immediate go-ahead (no approval needed)
- Good for quick experiments, prototyping, or testing an idea

### Hackathons
- Duration: **2–3 days (including any preparation)**  
- Require DMT approval before proceeding  
- Budgets may be requested (e.g. meals, small expenses) and must be agreed in advance  
- Maximum hackathon duration: **3 days**
- Great for building a proof of concept, or a small feature or toolchain enhancement.

!!! Example "All-department hackathons"
     Coordinated by the DMT, these periodic events will bring the whole department together to run multiple hackathons in parallel. 

## Process overview

1. **Idea**  
     - Anyone can generate an idea for a hackathon or minihack.  
     - For hackathons, complete a proposal template.

2. **Approval**  
     - Minihacks → no approval required, just find a Sponsor.
     - Hackathons → submit proposal to DMT for review.  

3. **Assign Sponsor & Coordinator**  
     - Once approved, a **DMT sponsor** should be assigned to guide and support the hackathon/minihack. 

4. **Team Formation**  
     - Define the required skills and team size.
     - Recruit participants and **appoint a Coordinator**.  

5. **Preparation**  
     - Agree the structure (virtual or in-person).
     - Determine and plan upfront preparation, such as upskilling, discovery, or design sessions.
     - Ensure participants commit fully to preparation and availability.

6. **Event Delivery**  
     - Run the hackathon or minihack.  
     - The Coordinator ensures collaboration, outcomes, and retrospectives.  

7. **Demos & Communication**  
     - Present at lightning talks or department meetings.
     - Publish a SharePoint news article.  
     - As required, prepare additional broader communications (e.g. open demo, wider presentation etc.).  

8. **Recognition & Next Steps**  
     - Share outcomes across the department.
     - Feed promising ideas into roadmap, insights, or operations planning.  
     - **Celebrate** the contributions, the value delivered, and what has been learned!

## Further Guidance

### Proposal Creation & Approval
  
Use the Hackathon Proposal template, found in the [Proposals library in SharePoint](https://adammatthewdigital.sharepoint.com/sites/Technology/Proposals/).  

   - Proposals should be concise but clear, and focussed on a singular, relevant objective.  
   - Add further context in appendices and linked docs as required.
   - Work with others to refine your proposal.

Once you have prepared a proposal, share it with the DMT for review and approval. Be prepared for feedback and to adapt your proposal.
  
**Minihacks do not require full proposals or approval**, however you must still ensure you have a clear singular, relevant objective.

!!! tip
     Proposals will be more likely to be approved if:

       -  They can clearly demonstrate potential value to the business and users.
       -  They are aligned with our business and product strategy.
       -  The objective is clear and distinct.

### Sponsorship

Every hackathon must have a DMT sponsor. They will support in enabling alignment with our strategic goals and act as an advocate. They can provide support for the coordinator if required.

### Coordinator responsibilities 

The coordinator is responsible for facilitating the event and ensuring it runs smoothly. 

They must take responsibility for:

- Planning and facilitating any pre-event communications, workshops etc.
- Ensuring the plan is clear and well understood.
- Ensuring everyone understands the role they play, and support them in keeping engaged. 
- Ensuring all perspectives are heard and valued.  
- Keeping the group focused on the objective and outcomes.  
- Supporting collaboration and manage conflicts constructively.  
- Ensuring effective documentation of decisions, outcomes, and learnings.  
- Communicating outcomes to the department (with support from the team).  
- Running a retrospective at the end of the hackathon.  

#### Running a great Hackathon 

- **Prepare early:** agree agenda, roles, and expectations before the event.  
- **Stay neutral:** focus on facilitation rather than driving your own solution.  
- **Balance voices:** actively bring quieter participants into the conversation.  
- **Bias towards action:** enable focus and momentum by setting clear time limits on discussions and moving towards decisions and actions.  
- **Keep it visible:** use shared boards, documents, or whiteboards so progress is transparent.  
- **Celebrate progress:** highlight wins, even if the final outcome isn’t fully realised.  
- **Follow through:** ensure retrospectives and outcomes are shared promptly. 

#### Planning a Great Hackathon

- **Keep teams small:** enable focus and agility.
- **Encourage junior colleagues:** or those new to the topic to join for learning, with clear roles (e.g. research, scribing, interviews).  
- **Adapt or cancel:** if the plan becomes unlikely to succeed.
- **Focus on small iterations and enhancements:** Consider possible eventual ideals and vision, but design for tangible and achievable gains.
- **In-person if possible** long-running, focussed collaboration is almost always more effective in-person.

### Outcomes and Sharing

Sharing outcomes ensures visibility, avoids duplication, and allows us to build on the work in our future objectives.  

- Always produce a SharePoint news article capturing objectives, outcomes, and learnings.  
- Present outcomes via lightning talks (e.g. Minihacks) or Department Meetings (e.g. Hackathons).  
- Teams should also choose broader company-wide communications such as demos or presentations to other groups.  

### Recognition and Follow-Through

Recognition and celebration is about collaboration, creativity, and learning, not just finished deliverables.

- Hackathon outcomes should be celebrated across the department and the business!  
- Ideas that show promise should lead to meaningful discussions about product or business enhancements.
