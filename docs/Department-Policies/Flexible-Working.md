## Technology Department Policy

As a primarily distributed department, each team member is required be in the Marlborough office **at least once per month**.

In addition, for those of us within reasonable commuting distance, we strongly encourage **at least one office visit per fortnight**. Members of the DMT commit to attending the office at least once per fortnight.

We **encourage weekly office attendance for those nearby** or whose roles or current work require or benefit from more regular face to face time.

## Communicating working locations 

### Using your calendar 

Please use the Outlook function to set your office/home working days. 

- If you have regular office days you can set them up here: https://outlook.office.com/mail/options/calendar/workSchedule  
- If you want to set or modify them on a case by case basis you can do so in your calendar

You can view who is planning to be in the office on any day using the Places tool: https://outlook.office.com/places. You can set “people you work with” to highlight their locations. This can be added to the apps in Teams for easy access, and is also available within the new Outlook calendar. 

### Communicating with your colleagues 

It’s always helpful to proactively inform others of your office attendance plans as well, especially if you do not visit the office frequently.

If your plans have had to change, reasonable efforts should be made to let others know with as much notice as possible.
