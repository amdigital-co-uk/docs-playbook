## 7 Key Principles of Privacy

These principles aim to embed privacy considerations into every aspect of system design and operation, ensuring that user privacy is protected proactively and consistently throughout the lifecycle of the product.

## 1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial
Design systems with privacy in mind from the outset. Anticipate potential privacy issues and address them before they occur, rather than waiting for problems to arise and then fixing them.

## 2. Privacy as the Default Setting
Ensure that personal data is protected by default in your systems. Users should not have to take any action to secure their privacy; the most privacy-friendly settings should be applied automatically.

## 3. Privacy Embedded into Design
Integrate privacy features seamlessly into the design and architecture of your systems. Privacy should not be an afterthought but a fundamental part of the system’s core functionality.

## 4. Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum
Strive for solutions that provide both privacy and full functionality. Avoid trade-offs between privacy and other goals; aim for a positive-sum approach where all objectives can be achieved without compromise.

## 5. End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection
Protect personal data throughout its entire lifecycle, from collection to deletion. Implement strong security measures to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and availability at all stages.

## 6. Visibility and Transparency – Keep it Open
Maintain transparency about how personal data is handled and processed. Make privacy practices clear and accessible to users, and ensure that your data processing activities are open to scrutiny.

## 7. Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric
Design systems that respect user privacy and put the interests of individuals first. Provide users with control over their personal data and make privacy-friendly options easy to use and understand.
